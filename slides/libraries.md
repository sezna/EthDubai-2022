#### Libraries


Note: 
In solidity, libraries are deployed to the chain and code is reused via a `DELEGATECALL` or an internal call. In solidity, 
libraries are used primarily to physically separate and chunk code on the chain.

----

1. Libraries are difficult to upgrade.
1. Libraries can be expensive to use.
1. Deployed libraries are hard to inspect.

----
```rust
library math;

pub fn exponentiate(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
 [ ... ]
}

pub struct Point3d {
  x: u64,
  y: u64,
  z: u64
}

pub trait Numeric {
 [ ... ]
}

```

Note: Public functions, structs, traits, etc. declared in a library can be directly imported and baked into the deployed code generated by Sway.
This means that library versioning is easy, the code is inspectable. If your contract exceeds the maximum deployable amount, then we automatically
chop it up and handle the calls between them. 

In Sway, libraries are used primarily to _logically_ separate code, more akin to a traditional language. 

----

### How is this possible?


Note: It is necessary to chunk deployed code due to the size limits of on-chain deployments. So, if we don't chunk via libraries,
is there an inherent limit to the size of a Sway program? No. 


----

#### Sway automatically chunks code on deployment.

Note: Sway automatically handles chunking and deploying code in such a way that the user doesn't need to be conscious of it. This means that the
programmer can focus on logical code organization, and not bytecode size constraints.
