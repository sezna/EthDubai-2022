## Sway: Writing Smart Contracts for the FuelVM

Alex Hansen

Fuel Labs

Note:
This talk will presume some level of elementary familiarity with both Solidity and Rust, but, if you have any questions, do feel free to ask.
This talk will also contain a lot of code examples and A/B comparisions, essentially amounting to a tutorial in Sway for those who know Solidity.
I will do my best to impart my jovial personality on this lecture, hopefully influencing your impressions of our language.
My name is Alex, the main compiler engineer at Fuel.
