# What is Sway?

Note:
  Sway was motivated by Solidity and Rust. We believe Rust made a lot of correct decisions in its implementation,
  and we want to combine that with the ergonomic first-class blockchain support that Solidity brings to the table. 
  Look at its adoption: it is used more than approaches that import libraries and APIs into existing general purpose langauges
  to accomplish the same task. Using a language designed for this domain is what people want.
